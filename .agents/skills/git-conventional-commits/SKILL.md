# Git Conventional Commits Skill

Professional git commit workflow that enforces best practices and conventions.

## Features

- **Conventional Commits Format**: Categorize commits by type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore)
- **Message Validation**: Adheres to the 7 rules of great git commits:
  - Separate subject from body with a blank line
  - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
  - Capitalize the subject line
  - Do not end the subject line with a period
  - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
  - Wrap the body at 72 characters
  - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
- **Auto-Detection**: Intelligently detects commit type based on file changes
- **Preview & Confirmation**: Shows formatted commit message before committing
- **Multi-Language Support**: English and Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)

## Commit Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Formatting, white-space, or semi-colon changes (no code meaning change) |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Code that improves performance |
| `test` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones |
| `build` | Changes to build-related components or dependencies |
| `ci` | Changes to the CI/CD setup |
| `chore` | Routine tasks or maintenance |

## When to Use

Reference this skill when you need to:

- Create a git commit with proper conventional format
- Ensure commit messages follow best practices
- Auto-detect the type of change being committed
- Preview and confirm commit messages before finalizing
- Support multiple commit message languages

## Example Usage

```bash
# Invoke the skill when you have staged or unstaged changes
# The skill will:

# 1. Analyze git status and changes
#    - Shows what files are modified/added/deleted
#    - Automatically stages appropriate files

# 2. Auto-detect commit type based on changes
#    - feat: New features (new files, new APIs)
#    - fix: Bug fixes (fixes existing functionality)
#    - docs: Documentation changes only
#    - style: Formatting changes (no logic change)
#    - refactor: Code restructuring (no logic change)
#    - perf: Performance optimizations
#    - test: Test additions/fixes
#    - build: Build system/dependency changes
#    - ci: CI/CD configuration changes
#    - chore: Maintenance tasks

# 3. Generate commit message
#    - Subject line: "{type}: {description}" (max 50 chars)
#    - Body (optional): Explains what and why
#    - Follows all 7 rules of great commit messages

# 4. **DISPLAY PREVIEW** - Saves to session temporary directory
#    Location: ~/.copilot/session-state/{session_id}/commit_preview.txt
#    
#    Content (plain text, fully readable):
#    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#    feat: Add user authentication
#    
#    Implement JWT-based auth system with secure token handling
#    and automatic refresh logic. Prevents users from being logged
#    out unexpectedly during long sessions.
#    
#    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#    Files: 3 changed | +145 insertions | -8 deletions
#    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#    
#    Benefits of using session temp directory:
#    - Does NOT pollute your project directory
#    - Will NOT be tracked by git
#    - Automatically cleaned up when session ends

# 5. **REQUEST USER CONFIRMATION**
#    - User is asked: "Please review the commit message in
#      ~/.copilot/session-state/{session_id}/commit_preview.txt
#      Do you want to proceed?"
#    - Mandatory: User must explicitly approve
#    - Options: ✅ Yes, confirm and commit | ❌ No, cancel commit

# 6. **EXECUTE COMMIT** (Only if confirmed)
#    If user approves:
#    git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication" \
#               -m "Implement JWT-based auth system..."
#    
#    If user declines:
#    Commit cancelled by user. (No changes made)
```

## Important: Preview & Confirmation

**This skill ALWAYS shows a preview and waits for explicit user confirmation before committing.**

This prevents accidental commits and ensures quality control. The preview step is mandatory and cannot be skipped.

**Preview File Location**: `~/.copilot/session-state/{session_id}/commit_preview.txt`
- Automatically cleaned up when session ends
- Not tracked by git
- Easy to find in your session folder

## Configuration

- **Default Language**: English
- **Commit Body**: Optional (automatically included when explaining "why" for complex changes)
- **Message Validation**: All messages validated against 7 rules before committing
- **Preview Storage**: Session temporary directory (not project directory)
